ok so mongo is very weird

go to /etc/mongodb.conf and make a replica set

replication:
   replSetName: "rs0"

then run the following commands (if authorization is enabled)

cd
openssl rand -base64 741 > mongodb.key
chmod 600 mongodb.key

and then in /etc/mongodb.conf

security:
  authorization: enabled
  keyFile: /home/USERNAME/mongodb.key

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scrap all of that, mongodb is utter dog poop and it just crashes when I create the file with literally no error. Big brain.
